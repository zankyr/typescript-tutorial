## How to

Each section/chapter of the course has been converted in a dedicated branch.

## Install Typescript

### In your project

1. First install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Then run the following command:
   ```shell
   npm install typescript --save-dev
   ```
3. You can try the Typescript compiler with this command:
   ```shell
   npx tsc
   ```

### Globally

A global installation allows you

- to install Typescript once, so you don't have to replicate the installation project-wide for each of your projects;
- to run the `tsc` command directly, without calling `npx`

To execute a global installation:

1. Run the command
   ```shell
   npm install -g typescript
   ```
